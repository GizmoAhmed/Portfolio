### About Juju

Juju is a game that I made in about 2 months shortly after I recreated Celeste Classic for a class. 
It started out as a simple question: What if Celeste had a gun? I am only partly kidding. Celeste Classic
is well designed because of tight platforming controls. Another questions I asked was how can I add more 
layers of gameplay to this?

The game is simple it has the same controls as Celeste except you shoot instead of dash. Shooting changes depending on what bullets you have in the chamber. The white bullet rockets you in a direction, the green one teleports you, the blue one makes a clone, and the red one moves blocks. 

Each room is a puzzle. Use the bullets to solve them.
